# RoomDB
This is a simple android app implementation focusing on my go to Room + MVVM setup for most of my apps.
It also makes use of Kotlin Coroutines & Kotlin KTX extensions


## Functionalities
The app currently consumes various Room APIs including
- READ
- WRITE
- UPDATE
- DELETE

##Interesting Room catches
- seed data on database creation
- use of coroutines to run queries on background threads
- use of multiple tables in the db
- update that include entities with unique autogenerated primary keys
